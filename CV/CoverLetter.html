        To whom it may concern,<br><br>

        My name is Edoardo Martella and I am writing to apply for the Conversion course in computing at your esteemed
        institution.<br><br>
        My background in IT dates back to my high school education. There I received solid training in object-oriented
        software development (Java), IT systems, relational databases, and web development. While studying for my
        bachelor’s, I worked part-time as a software developer for a small Italian enterprise, applying and expanding my
        knowledge.<br>
        Nevertheless, for my university studies I decided to follow my other interest – politics and international
        relations. In addition to my enthusiasm for these topics, I also had the opportunity to travel to many countries
        and appreciate different cultures and perspectives. This experience broadened my understanding of the world and
        reinforced my intercultural and interpersonal skills.<br>
        After the completion of my master’s degree, I realized that the job opportunities related to my studies were
        limited and did not meet my current interests. Therefore, I applied for a competitive graduate program in the
        logistics industry. During this time, I witnessed firsthand the crucial need for IT skills in the field.
        Engaging in IT integration projects and software development using the Microsoft Power Platform, I rediscovered
        the satisfaction of employing my problem-solving skills and creativity to make a meaningful impact.
        <br>Passion, good learning skills and on-the-job experience are important to pursue a career in IT; however, I
        recognize the need for formal education in computing. Apart from being a key component of succeeding in the
        competitive landscape of IT job applications, it will help me to approach software development in a more
        structured, efficient, and professional manner. Therefore, I am excited about the Springboard + Conversion
        course in Computing at ATU Donegal. It is a unique opportunity to bridge my knowledge gap and pursue a career in
        IT, either within my current company or the broader industry.
        <br><br>I am highly motivated to undertake this journey and dedicate the necessary time and energy to succeed in
        my studies. As denoted by my academic history, I have continuously demonstrated the ability to excel in diverse
        subjects while balancing part-time work. Additionally, I am confident that my understanding of IT thanks to my
        previous and current experiences will surely facilitate my studies.
        I sincerely hope that you will consider my application for the Conversion course in Computing favourably. I am
        excited about the possibility of studying at NCI and earning the Higher Diploma, which will be a crucial
        landmark in my career.
        Thank you for your time and consideration.
        <br><br>Kind regards,
        <br>Edoardo Martella
