                    To whom it may concern,</p>

                <p>My name is Edoardo Martella and I am writing to apply for the Conversion course in computing at your
                    esteemed
                    institution.</p>
                <p>My background in IT dates back to my high school education. There I received solid training in
                    object-oriented
                    software development (Java), IT systems, relational databases, and web development. While studying
                    for my
                    bachelor’s, I worked part-time as a software developer for a small Italian enterprise, applying and
                    expanding my
                    knowledge.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, for my university studies I decided to follow my other interest – politics and
                    international
                    relations. In addition to my enthusiasm for these topics, I also had the opportunity to travel to
                    many countries
                    and appreciate different cultures and perspectives. This experience broadened my understanding of
                    the world and
                    reinforced my intercultural and interpersonal skills.</p>
                <p>After the completion of my master’s degree, I realized that the job opportunities related to my
                    studies were
                    limited and did not meet my current interests. Therefore, I applied for a competitive graduate
                    program in the
                    logistics industry. During this time, I witnessed firsthand the crucial need for IT skills in the
                    field.
                    Engaging in IT integration projects and software development using the Microsoft Power Platform, I
                    rediscovered
                    the satisfaction of employing my problem-solving skills and creativity to make a meaningful impact.
                </p>
                <p>Passion, good learning skills and on-the-job experience are important to pursue a career in IT;
                    however, I
                    recognize the need for formal education in computing. Apart from being a key component of succeeding
                    in the
                    competitive landscape of IT job applications, it will help me to approach software development in a
                    more
                    structured, efficient, and professional manner. Therefore, I am excited about the Springboard +
                    Conversion
                    course in Computing at ATU Donegal. It is a unique opportunity to bridge my knowledge gap and pursue
                    a career in
                    IT, either within my current company or the broader industry.</p>
                <p>I am highly motivated to undertake this journey and dedicate the necessary time and energy to succeed
                    in
                    my studies. As denoted by my academic history, I have continuously demonstrated the ability to excel
                    in diverse
                    subjects while balancing part-time work. Additionally, I am confident that my understanding of IT
                    thanks to my
                    previous and current experiences will surely facilitate my studies.
                    I sincerely hope that you will consider my application for the Conversion course in Computing
                    favourably. I am
                    excited about the possibility of studying at NCI and earning the Higher Diploma, which will be a
                    crucial
                    landmark in my career.
                    Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
                <p>Kind regards,</p>
                <p>Edoardo Martella</p>
